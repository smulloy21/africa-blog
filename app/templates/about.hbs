    <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    <p>My name is Connie - I'm a home care Occupational Therapist in the DC area. When not giving 100% to help my patients, you can find me at home with my husband of 25+ years and our six (SIX!) dogs.</p>
    <p>This blog is to preserve memories of our recent trip to Africa - I hope you enjoy.</p><br>
